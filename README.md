# DTMF Tone Detection Using MATLAB
This Project was one of the final projects of my Signals and Systems course in the university. A set of Tone Vectors are aligned with each number for them to be heard accurately and without interference. Also, Fourier transforms are used as a reverse model to find numbers based on their tones.
